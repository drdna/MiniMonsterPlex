## Data Input
Fastq files with either a .fq or .fastq extension should be gzip compressed, extention .gz, and dropped into the [fastq/](fastq) folder before running. If your files are all uncompressed try using this command in the [fastq/](fastq) folder to bulk compress them:
```
bgzip *.fastq
```
or
```
bgzip *.fq
```
Depnding on what extension your files are.

## Command Line Functions
```
Python3 MiniMonsterPlex.py -o [output folder name] -m [.csv metadata file name] -r [raxml binary name] -i [isolate_1] [isolate_2] -il [example.txt] -hf [host_1] [host_2] -hfl [example.txt] -h
```
+ ```-h```= Help command: including this flag will bring up the help screen.
+ ```-o```= Output Folder: User given name for the created output folder. When no option is used it defaults to output. **Note** only two folders can have the same name so only one default folder can exist at a time.
+ ```-m```= Metadata file: Name of the .csv metadata file formatted as shown below.
+ ```-r```=Raxml version: the name of the standard raxml binary

Filtering options:

**Raxml requires a minium of 4 isolates in a multi fasta file to generate a tree. If you do not provide 4 isolates or your chosen host does not have 4 isolates the program will stop and ask if you want to continue without filtering or quit entirely.**

NOTE: Isolate should be the name of the file you are uploading minus the extenesions: so SRR1571.fq.gz will be SRR1571. Host names should be the exact same as those entered into your metadata file.

+ ```-i```= Isolate list[Optional]: a space seperated list of all isolates you want included in the tree building. 
+ ```-il```= Isolate file[Optional]: a new line seperated txt file of all isolates you want included in the tree building. This can be combined with -i.
+ ```-hf```= Host list[Optional]: a space seperated list of all isolates from the specfic hosts listed you want in tree building.
+ ```-hfl```= Host file[Optional]: a new line seperated txt file of all hosts you want included in the tree building. This can be combined with -hf.

The host and isolate filtering can be combined. In that case the program will first filter by host and then filter by isolate. 

## Metadata Format

MiniMonsterPlex requires a custom .csv format for metadata:
```
sampleID,species,host,country
104,Po,Oryza,China
```
* ```sampleID``` is the exact name of the fastq file given to MiniMonsterPlex so in this example it would be *104.fastq*.
* ```species``` is the name of the species to which the sample belongs.
* ```host``` is the host genus of the pathogen.
* ```country``` is the country of origin.

A sample csv file can be found as [metadata.csv](metadata.csv)

## RAXML 
* Build the Standard Sequential RAXML version listed in [Requirements](https://github.com/TrStans606/MiniMonsterPlex/blob/main/README.md#requirements) from source
* The Stanard, SSE3, or AVX version will work.
* Move the created exectuable to the MiniMonsterPlex directory
* Provide the exact name of the RAXML binary as the -r argument
